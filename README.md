# to-do-list

![Todo List Screenshot](https://github.com/jayeclark/to-do-list/blob/main/todo-screenshot.png?raw=true)
A styled version of a To Do list using React useState.

Working off the boilerplate example, I added empty checkboxes along the left hand side that changed to 'checked' when clicked. The task background also gets darker and the text changes to green. I also separated out the 'remove' option into its own div, and the checkboxes will only be removed if that specific area is clicked (not the entire todo item.)

## Future Improvements
Over the course of the week, I'd like to turn this into a basic Kanban board, and add animations for when tasks are completed. For now, I'm posting as is so that I can complete the rest of the coursework for the week and return to this
[ ] Change the mouse display to indicate clickable areas
[ ] Add tooltips on hover
[ ] Add timers to tasks
[ ] Change the color of tasks as the timer ticks down
[ ] Add snooze to tasks
[ ] Add Pomodoro mode
[ ] Separate into columns based on status and limit pomodoro mode to the "in progress" column
[ ] Make tasks draggable among the columns
[ ] Automate movement between columns based on certain actions
[ ] Allow users to add their own columns
[ ] Add complexity to task records (i.e. title & description, additional fields, task dependency, etc.
[ ] Allow drag & drop or ctrl-click selection of multiple tasks
[ ] Create 'trash bin' of completed tasks at the bottom of the screen.
