# to-do-list

![Todo List Screenshot](https://github.com/jayeclark/to-do-list/blob/main/todo-screenshot.png?raw=true)  
This project demonstrates a styled version of a To Do list using React.useState.

Working off the boilerplate example, I added empty checkboxes along the left hand side that changed to 'checked' when clicked. The task background also gets darker and the text changes to green. I also separated out the 'remove' option into its own div, and the checkboxes will only be removed if that specific area is clicked (not the entire todo item.)

## Future Improvements
I'd like to turn this into a basic Kanban board, add a 'pomodoro mode' that lets you stage tasks for 25 minute bursts and set a timer, and add animations for when tasks are completed.

- [ ] Add snooze to tasks  
- [ ] Add Pomodoro mode  
- [ ] Separate into columns based on status and limit pomodoro mode to the "in progress" column  
- [ ] Make tasks draggable among the columns  
- [ ] Automate movement between columns based on certain actions  
- [ ] Allow users to add their own columns  
- [ ] Add complexity to task records (i.e. title & description, additional fields, task dependency, etc.  
- [ ] Allow drag & drop or ctrl-click selection of multiple tasks  
- [ ] Create 'trash bin' of completed tasks at the bottom of the screen.
